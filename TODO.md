TODO List

Algorithm Accuracy: 

Each algorithm currently displays results, but some are not yet accurate. Working on refining the calculations for better reliability.

KNN Performance: 

The KNN algorithm is taking approximately 5 minutes to display results. Investigating the cause and actively working on optimizing its performance.


Database Integration: 

The biggest challenge is handling various database structures with different variable names. Progress is being made toward a flexible solution.
